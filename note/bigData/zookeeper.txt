server.A=B.:C:D

A:表示一个数字，这个数字表示第几个服务器，配置在myid的文件

B:服务器地址，也就是ip地址

C:本台服务器与集群中的lender服务器交换信息端口

D:万一leader挂了就需要这个端口重新选举

4.集群最少要几台机器

Finally, note the two port numbers after each server name: " 2888" and "3888". 
Peers use the former port to connect to other peers. 
Such a connection is necessary so that peers can communicate, 
for example, to agree upon the order of updates. More specifically, 
a ZooKeeper server uses this port to connect followers to the leader. 
When a new leader arises, a follower opens a TCP connection to the leader using this port. 
Because the default leader election also uses TCP, 
we currently require another port for leader election. 
This is the second port in the server entry.
