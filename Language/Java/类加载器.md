> Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader()

This is the current thread classloader and doesn't depend on the class calling it

> TestServlet.class.getClassLoader()

This is the classloader that loaded the TestServlet class.

> please explain as well as provide me example when to use these

Let's imagine you have Thread1 owned by ClassLoader1 and Thread2 owned by ClassLoader2. It's possible that you load your TestServlet class on Thread2 (by ClassLoader2) and then pass it to Thread1. At that point, if TestServlet needs to load a Class owned by ClassLoader1 it will need to use Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader(), as it's own ClassLoader is ClassLoader2 and not ClassLoader1.
